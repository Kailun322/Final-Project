# This is my Master's Project and my coding file.
Note that I have used multiple datasets to train the model but I only include one coding file.
All the coding for the different datasets are essientially same.
If you want to use my code, please change the pathway and caculate the mean and std for your dataset first.
Then everything should work fine for using the code.
